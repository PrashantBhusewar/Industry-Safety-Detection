# Industry-Safety-Detection
Object Detection project on Industry Safety Detection using YOLO-v7

## What is Industry Safety Detection
Creating a detection system using computer vision and machine learning to monitor, track, and enforce employees/workers to wear the necessary protective gear. ISD is designed and modelled to take a real-time image of the personnel as the input and determine if the five segments - helmet, gloves, jacket, goggles and footwear are worn before entering the workplace, and record the procedures as well. If ISD does not find any of the safety gear, the worker will not be allowed to proceed and the prohibition alarm in the system will alert the authorities.


## Problem Statement
In recent decades, there's been a lot of neglect in terms of safety and well-being in most industries. The practice of safety culture and safety climate: is growing every day to safeguard all workers/employees in the work environment. Government bodies and other regulatory organisations have implemented rules and laws which ensure that employers/companies create working conditions that nullify, or at the very least minimise the probabilities of accidents, injuries, etc. in the workplace. Ignorance, incompetence, lack of knowledge/training and overconfidence among other human errors also play a part in the occurrence of such negative incidents.


## Scope of Application
This scope of the project focuses on identifying the equipment of industrial workers by detecting all the safety gear such as helmets, gloves, jackets, goggles and footwear. By that, the system can determine if the employee/worker is properly safe to do their work or not. The data of detections are also uploaded into the local database.

## Solution proposed 
The main point of this application Creating a detection system using Computer Vision and Machine Learning to monitor, track and enforce employees/workers to wear the necessary protection gears. ISD is designed and modelled to take a real-time image of the personnel as the input and determine if the five segments - helmet, gloves, jacket, goggles and footwear are worn before entering the workplace, and record the procedures as well. If ISD does not find any of the safety gears, the worker will not be allowed to proceed and the prohibition alarm in the system will alert the authorities.
